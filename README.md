# opensurgbot_3Dprinted
3D printed parts of the opensurgbot platform




Finished:

Assembly of the connecting part between servos, slider, and the surgical clip.

Files found in /Platform

3D printed items:

disc_clipper.SLDPRT * 4

lid.SLDPRT * 1

press.SLDPRT * 1




laser cutting:

丝杆垫片.SLDPRT * 2

丝杆连接件.SLDPRT * 1




To do:

1. Seperate "press.SLDPRT" so that the gap between spring and blocker can be decreased. Might also need to change "lid.SLDPRT" to create room for the seperated parts.

2. Add a supporter to the "lid.SLDPRT" or other files. May consider to hold the surgical bar to stablize it. The platform is not that stable and is suspectible to tipping at present. This might also be because the 4 disc_clipper is not even, leading to tipping and the failure of using motor to drive the surgical tool.

3. Add a T-shape connector to connect this platform (the slider and the step motor) to the robot arm.
